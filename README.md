## Introduction

The COVID-19 Analysis project utilizes SQL for data exploration and analysis. By structuring and querying datasets related to COVID-19, we aim to provide valuable insights into the spread of the virus, recovery rates, and other relevant metrics.

## Data Sources

- World Health Organization (WHO)
- Johns Hopkins University
- Other reliable sources providing COVID-19 data

## Database Schema

The database schema is designed to capture essential information about COVID-19, including cases, deaths, and recoveries. It may include tables such as:

- `cases`: Information about confirmed cases.
- `deaths`: Information about reported deaths.
- `recoveries`: Information about recovered cases.
- `countries`: Geographical data about countries.

## Queries

Several SQL queries are implemented to analyze the data, including:

- Total number of cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Daily new cases.
- Recovery rates.
- Geographical trends.

## Results

The results of the SQL queries are presented through visualizations or summary tables, providing a clear understanding of the COVID-19 situation based on the available data.

## Usage

1. Set up a SQL database and import the provided dataset.
2. Execute SQL queries using your preferred database management tool.
3. Analyze the results to gain insights into the COVID-19 data.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and submit a pull request.
